The [Sequence Labeling](Tasks/NLP/Tasks/Sequence%20Labeling.md) model architecture provided by [FLAIR](Tasks/NLP/FLAIR.md).

This is a Bidirectional [LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)](Algorithms/Models/ANN/Components/Layers/LSTM%20(Long%20Short-Term%20Memory).md) with [CRF (Conditional Random Field)](Algorithms/Models/Supervised/General/CRF%20(Conditional%20Random%20Field).md), which also uses [Stacked Embeddings](Tasks/NLP/Semantic%20Analysis/Embeddings/Stacked%20Embeddings.md).
