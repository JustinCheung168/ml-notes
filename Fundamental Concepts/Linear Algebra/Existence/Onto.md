Also known as **surjective**.

Let:
- $T: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, where $p \geq n$

A transformation $T$ is onto iff its [Image](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Existence/Image.md) is the entire [Codomain](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Codomain.md). 
In other words: $\text{Image}(T)=\mathbb{R}^n$.

In other other words: every point in the output space is covered by $T$.

Here is a function which is onto but not [Into](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Uniqueness/Into.md):
