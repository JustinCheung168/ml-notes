Also known as **bijective**.

Let:
- $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$

$T$ is invertible iff it is both [Into](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Uniqueness/Into.md) and [Onto](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Existence/Onto.md).
This is only possible if the input space equals the output space.

See the [Invertible Matrix Theorem](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Invertibility/Invertible%20Matrix%20Theorem.md) for consequences of this.

A square matrix which is not invertible is called [Singular](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Invertibility/Singular.md).

Here is a function which is invertible:
