Two vectors are orthogonal if their [Inner Product](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Inner%20Product.md) is 0.

Orthogonal vectors which are nonzero always have [Linear Independence](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Uniqueness/Linear%20Independence.md).

Annoyingly, an **orthogonal matrix** is defined as a matrix whose columns are [Orthonormal](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Orthonormal.md) (**not just orthogonal**) to each other. So it is another word for an **orthonormal matrix**.
