Let:
- $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$
- $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$

$X$ is the standard matrix of $T$ constructed in the following way:
$$X=\left[T(\mathbf{e}_1) | T(\mathbf{e}_2) |...| T(\mathbf{e}_n)\right]$$
where $\mathbf{e}_i$ is an elementary vector, being the $i$-th column of $I$.

This is how you should define a matrix for a linear transformation.

$X$ is convenient in that it is exactly what the identity matrix $I$ should end up being after each vector is transformed by $T$.
