Also known as **injective**, or as **one-to-one**.

Let:
- $T: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, where $p \leq n$
- $\boldsymbol{0}_p\in \mathbb{R}^p$

A transformation $T$ is into if every distinct input maps to a distinct output; also see [Linear Independence](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Uniqueness/Linear%20Independence.md).
(i.e. no two inputs share the same output value)

It turns out to be true that $T$ is into iff $\text{Ker}(T)=\{\mathbf{0}_p\}$
(i.e. the only way to produce zero is to put in zero.)

Here is a function which is into but not [Onto](Fundamental%20Concepts/Linear%20Algebra/Existence/Onto.md):
