$r$. Measure of linear relationship between two variables.

Uncorrelated variables are not necessarily [Independent](Fundamental%20Concepts/Statistics/Independent.md), and dependent variables are not necessarily correlated. Consider $Y=X^2$, where $X$ and $Y$ are clearly not independent, and yet they are uncorrelated. 

Standardized form of [Covariance](Fundamental%20Concepts/Statistics/Covariance.md) which takes out sensitivity to scale. Specifically:
$r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$

This implies that $r$ has range $[-1,1]$.
