Also known as True Positive Rate.

$\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$

Alternate definitions:
$\frac{TP}{P}$

Ability for the model to "recall" the positives.
Think of this as "safety" - it's the conservative success of the model if positive needs to be caught, regardless of whether too much negative is also caught.
