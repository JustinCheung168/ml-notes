The task of determining 

Two types:
- 

# Relations
The term "relation" is overloaded term. 

In text: a relation is a semantic predicate and its arguments, like "married" to "Willoughby" and "Miss Grey" in Willoughby married Miss Grey.

In a knowledge base: a **relation** is a tuple of predicate of known semantic to its arugments. Like:
(predicate (per:spouse), argument1 (Willoughby), argument2)

It's about the state of marriage, not the event.

"Entity-valued relations" - both arguments of the relation are entities.

"String-filled relations" - one argument is entity, another is a string. You might think of the string as a property of the entity, and perhaps this isn't even a relation at all depending on what you think.
