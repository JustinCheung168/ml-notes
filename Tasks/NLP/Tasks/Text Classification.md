As the name implies, it's the task of classifying text. So typical machine learning classification models apply.

Typical models:
- [NBC (Naive Bayes Classifier)](Algorithms/Models/Supervised/General/NBC%20(Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier).md) as an easy first pass.

Example subtasks:
- [Sentiment Analysis](Tasks/NLP/Tasks/Sentiment%20Analysis.md) (Sentiment Classification)
