The task of distinguishing the multiple senses a single word might have.

An optional but very useful task to consider applying to [IR (Information Retrieval)](Tasks/NLP/Tasks/IR%20(Information%20Retrieval).md), [MT (Machine Translation)](Tasks/NLP/Tasks/MT%20(Machine%20Translation).md), [NER (Named Entity Recognition)](Tasks/NLP/Tasks/NER%20(Named%20Entity%20Recognition).md), etc.

You typically need an existing inventory of senses for each word.
